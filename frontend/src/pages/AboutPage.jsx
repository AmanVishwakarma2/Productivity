              At Fresh, we believe that productivity isn't just about doing moreâ€”it's about doing what matters 
              most while maintaining balance and well-being. Our application is designed with these principles in mind:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Simplicity:</strong> We focus on clean, intuitive interfaces that don't get in your way.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Balance:</strong> We encourage regular breaks and mindfulness practices alongside focused work.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Privacy:</strong> Your data belongs to you. We prioritize your privacy and security.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consistency:</strong> Small, consistent actions lead to significant results over time.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
